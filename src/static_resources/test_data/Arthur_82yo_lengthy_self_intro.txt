I. Personal Background & Medical Information:

*   Overall Health: Generally good for my age. I have some stiffness in my knees and a mild tremor in my left hand, but nothing that significantly impacts my mobility. I am physically capable of walking for moderate distances, but require regular breaks.
*   Medical Conditions:
    *   Mild Osteoarthritis: Primarily affects knees.  I take Ibuprofen 20mg as needed for pain.
    *   Mild Tremor: Affects left hand. It’s more noticeable when I’m holding things for a long time.  I've been told it’s related to age.
    *   High Blood Pressure: Controlled with Lisinopril 10mg daily. 
    *   No known allergies.  (However, please be mindful of potential allergens in food - see section IV).
*   Medications:
    *   Lisinopril 10mg (daily)
    *   Ibuprofen 20mg (as needed for pain)
    *   Vitamin D supplement (as recommended by my doctor)
*   Mobility: I use a sturdy walking stick for stability, especially on uneven surfaces. I am comfortable using elevators, but stairs are a challenge. I would appreciate accessible accommodations with elevators wherever possible. 
*   Cognitive Function:  My mind is sharp, though I do sometimes forget names or details.  I am generally oriented and able to communicate effectively. 
*   Emergency Protocols:  Eleanor Penhaligon is my primary emergency contact.  She has a copy of my medical information and insurance details.  I have an emergency medical alert bracelet with my name, medical conditions, and allergy information.



II.  Travel Interests & Preferences:

*   Travel Style: I prefer a relaxed pace of travel, focusing on experiencing the local culture rather than rushing from place to place. I appreciate opportunities for quiet reflection and downtime. I enjoy immersing myself in history and art, but not in overwhelming crowds.
*   Historical & Cultural Interests: I am deeply fascinated by ancient civilizations, particularly Roman and Renaissance periods.  I've always been captivated by the architecture, the art, and the stories of these eras.  I would be very interested in guided tours that delve into the history and significance of the sites.  I'd also enjoy visiting local museums showcasing regional art and craftsmanship.
*   Art & Architecture:  I have a particular fondness for Renaissance art, especially the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael.  I'm also interested in Roman architecture – the Colosseum, the Pantheon, aqueducts, and the Forum.  I’d be delighted to visit smaller, lesser-known artistic gems as well, not just the major landmarks.
*   Food & Drink:  Food is a huge part of travel for me!  I'm eager to experience authentic Italian cuisine – not just the tourist-trap versions.  I’m open to trying new things, but I have some dietary considerations (see Section IV).  I’m particularly interested in regional specialties. I'm also a fan of Italian wines, especially Chianti and Pinot Grigio.
*   Outdoor Activities:  Gentle walks through parks and gardens are enjoyable. I would be happy to take a leisurely boat trip on the canals of Venice, but nothing too strenuous. I'm not interested in hiking or other physically demanding activities.
*   Evening Activities:  I prefer quiet evenings – a comfortable meal, perhaps some live music (classical or jazz would be lovely), or a relaxing stroll.  I'm not a fan of loud nightlife. 
*  Pace of Travel:  I prefer a slower, more deliberate pace.  I don't want to feel rushed to see everything, and I appreciate time to rest and absorb the atmosphere.



III.  Accommodation & Transportation Preferences:

*   Accommodation:  I would appreciate accommodations with comfortable beds, good lighting, and accessible bathrooms (grab bars, shower chair if necessary).  A balcony or terrace would be a bonus.  I prefer smaller, boutique hotels or charming guesthouses over large, impersonal chain hotels.  Proximity to public transportation is also desirable.
*   Transportation: I prefer to use public transportation (buses, trains) whenever possible. However, I need to be able to easily access taxis or ride-sharing services if needed, especially when travelling between cities or for shorter distances within cities. I'd like to avoid long walks between destinations whenever possible.  I would appreciate assistance with navigating public transport, if available.  



IV. Dietary & Sensory Considerations:

*   Dietary Restrictions:  I am generally able to eat a wide variety of foods, but I have a few preferences and sensitivities:
    *   Gluten-Intolerant: I have mild gluten intolerance. While a completely gluten-free diet isn't necessary, I would be grateful for options that minimize gluten intake, especially bread and pasta. 
    *   Sodium:  I need to watch my sodium intake due to my high blood pressure.  I would appreciate meals with moderate sodium levels. 
    *    Dairy: I'm lactose intolerant.  I can tolerate small amounts of cheese, but large quantities can cause discomfort. 
    *  Spicy Foods: I am not a fan of spicy food.  Please avoid dishes with chili peppers or other strong spices.
    *   Vegetarian Options:  I am not vegetarian, but I appreciate restaurants offering a few vegetarian dishes.
*   Sensory Sensitivities:  
    *   Crowded Environments:  Very crowded restaurants or attractions can be overwhelming. I prefer quieter, less crowded spaces.
    *   Bright Lights & Loud Noises:  I find extremely bright lights and loud noises can be irritating.  I prefer moderate lighting and a relatively calm atmosphere.
*   Food Allergies:  (None known, but please confirm ingredients if I'm trying something new).




V. Special Assistance Needs:

*   Mobility Assistance: As mentioned, I use a walking stick and require accessible accommodations. Assistance with navigating stairs or uneven terrain would be greatly appreciated. 
*   Rest & Breaks:  I need regular opportunities to rest and recharge. I appreciate flexible itineraries that allow for spontaneous breaks. 
*   Communication: I sometimes have trouble hearing in noisy environments.  If possible, please be patient and speak slowly.
*   Cognitive Support: While my cognitive function is generally good, I sometimes benefit from reminders or clarifications.  
*   Emergency Preparedness:  I would appreciate having access to emergency contact information and a plan in case of any medical issue.



VI.  Desired Level of Assistance:

*   Independent Travel: I prefer to travel independently as much as possible. 
*   Guided Tours:  I would welcome guided tours that cater to travelers with mobility needs.
*   Personal Concierge Services:  If available, I would appreciate access to concierge services for assistance with booking transportation, making reservations, or finding local information.
